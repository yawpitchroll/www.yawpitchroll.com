**Standing at the punch table swallowing punch**

Can't pay attention to the **sound** of anyone...

**A little more stupid, a little more scared**

Every minute more unprepared

I made a mistake in my life today  
Everything I love gets lost in drawers  
I want to start over, I want to be winning  
Way out of sync from the beginning

**I wanna hurry home to you**

```bash
$ Put on a slow, dumb show for you and crack you up
```

So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightening, I'll overdo it
