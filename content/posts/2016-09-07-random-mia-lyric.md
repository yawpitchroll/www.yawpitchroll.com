**If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name...**

Third world democracy... Yeah, I got more records than the  **K.G.B.** So, uh, no funny business...

**Sometimes I think sitting on trains**

Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner now we're making that fame
Bonafide hustler making my name

**Pirate skulls and bones**

Sticks and stones and weed and bombs
Running when we hit 'em

    $ Lethal poison through their system

All I wanna do is
And
And take your money
